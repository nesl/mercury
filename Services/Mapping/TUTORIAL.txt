[QGIS]
QGIS itself can download part of the map by specifying the lat/long range. See http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/osm-in-qgis/ for tutorial. The map downloading can be issued by clicked "Download data." The downloaded file should come with a file extension .osm extension, nevertheless the file itself is an xml. Briefly scanning it, the atom element seems to be node. The road/street is coded in way element, with a list of nd elements, the ref elements of which refer to the node elements by id. Probably it's the way to get the road path.
