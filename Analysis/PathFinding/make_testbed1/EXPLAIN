The area of testbed1 is in the west of UCLA, bounded by Weyburn Ave, Gayley,
Veteran and Strathmore, plus the Westwood Plaza. The purpose of the python script
is to plot the segments of this area, or, create the .tfix file.

The python script loads the osm segmented map and the crossPoints.txt.
The file crossPoints.txt records all the interested cross points.
It creates the .tfix file that the end points of each segment always stick on
the intersections.
