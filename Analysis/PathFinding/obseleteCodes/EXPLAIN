WARNING: the data folder in the codes might not be correct.

A historial folder stores the previous codes which tries to prove small concepts or
parts of one certain algorithm work. 

step1_*.m tested on the DTW algorithm based on performing DTW(baro data, true ele path)

step2_*.m tested on including some false elevation trajectories, whether DTW can
select the correct elevation trajectories.

The step3_*.m has been renamed to searchATruePath.m and is currently the major code
to execute. This version find the correct path searching from the map instead of
given elevation trajectories.
