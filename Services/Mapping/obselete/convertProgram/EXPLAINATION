How the codes under this folder got obseleted:

Original path of this folder: <mercury>/Services/Mapping/

The codes achieve the following things:
  - Parse .osm files, extract the 'way' elements, and suit into proper format for
    next step parsing
  - There's no technical consumer of these codes, as they are replaced by the
    codes under 'fixProgram'. There's a website to visualize the result, the website
    got obseleted, too.
