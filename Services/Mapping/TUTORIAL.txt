Possible website to download maps:
- http://download.geofabrik.de/
- https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/

Software to open the map:
- QGIS, installation instruction in http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu


[QGIS]
QGIS itself can download part of the map by specifying the lat/long range. See
http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/osm-in-qgis/ for tutorial. The map downloading
can be issued by clicking "Vector" -> "OpenStreetMap" -> "Download data."
The downloaded file should come with a file extension .osm extension, but keep
in mind the file itself is an xml. To check the correctness of the file,
well I forgot the correct way to load the .osm, but simply dragging the file into
QGIS window works.
By briefly scanning it very quickly, the atom element seems to be node. The road/street is
coded in way element, with a list of nd elements, the ref elements
of which refer to the node elements by id. Currently we use this strategy to
generate road network.
